# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Alexey Gorbunov

## Bioinformatician | ML/NLP-enthusiast | Vibe Coder | Professional ðŸ¤¡

### At the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR
I specialize in NGS data analysis and optimizing workflows to improve efficiency. Over the past year, I have developed extensive Groovy/Nextflow code to meet the centerâ€™s local requirements. Additionally, I have explored and implemented various ML/NLP tools and protocols to stay up to date with the latest technological advancements.

### Languages, Tools and skills:
